The goal of this project is to create a composition utility that can do a variety of useful tasks.

* Determine the mode or possible modes of a motive
* Transpose the motive to all possible diatonic modes.
* Augmentation and diminuation of rhythm.
* Transpose each mode of the motive to all different keys.
* Render the output to either a Musescore file or a Lilypond file, perhaps both.
